# Stock-Price-Predication-Using-LSTM

In this project i have used " Artificial Recurrent Neural Network" also called as " Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)".

Used Data Dataset of Apple INC from the yahoo and to predict stock price used past 100 days stock price .

Get The Value of root mean squared error(RMSE) is as follow:
